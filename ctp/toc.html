  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Golf Slope Reader Pro does not collect, store, or share any personal data.</p>
  <p>The app uses on-device sensors (accelerometer) to detect slope angles for the purpose of providing real-time golf insights. All sensor processing is done locally on your device.</p>
  <p>Voice feedback is provided using the system’s built-in Text-to-Speech engine. Vibration feedback is triggered locally based on slope intensity.</p>
  <p>This app does not connect to the internet and does not transmit any data to any server.</p>
  <p>We take privacy seriously and ensure full compliance with Google Play policies, the GDPR, and other global data protection laws.</p>
